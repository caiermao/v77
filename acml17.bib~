  abstract =     {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded the excellent performance in a variety of computer vision tasks, where CNNs typically adopt a similar structure consisting of convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers. In this paper, we propose to apply a novel method, namely Hybrid Orthogonal Projection and Estimation (HOPE), to CNNs in order to introduce orthogonality into the CNN structure. The HOPE model can be viewed as a hybrid model to combine feature extraction using orthogonal linear projection with mixture models. It is an effective model to extract useful information from the original high-dimension feature vectors and meanwhile filter out irrelevant noises. In this work, we present three different ways to apply the HOPE models to CNNs, i.e., {\em HOPE-Input}, {\em single-HOPE-Block} and {\em multi-HOPE-Blocks}. For {\em HOPE-Input} CNNs, a HOPE layer is directly used right after the input to de-correlate high-dimension input feature vectors. Alternatively, in {\em single-HOPE-Block} and {\em multi-HOPE-Blocks} CNNs, we consider to use HOPE layers to replace one or more blocks in the CNNs, where one block may include several convolutional layers and one pooling layer. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet databases have shown that the orthogonal constraints imposed by the HOPE layers can significantly improve the performance of CNNs in these image classification tasks (we have achieved one of the best performance when image augmentation has not been applied, and top 5 performance with image augmentation).},

  abstract =     {End-to-end learning refers to training a possibly complex learning system by applying gradient-based learning to the system as a whole. End-to-end learning systems are specifically designed so that all modules are differentiable. In effect, not only a central learning machine, but also all ``peripheral'' modules like representation learning and memory formation are covered by a holistic learning process. The power of end-to-end learning has been demonstrated on many tasks, like playing a whole array of Atari video games with a single architecture. While pushing for solutions to more challenging tasks, network architectures keep growing more and more complex.
In this paper we ask the question whether and to what extent end-to-end learning is a future-proof technique in the sense of \emph{scaling} to complex and diverse data processing architectures. We point out potential inefficiencies, and we argue in particular that end-to-end learning does not make optimal use of the modular design of present neural networks. Our surprisingly simple experiments demonstrate these inefficiencies, up to the complete breakdown of learning.},

Among the two major methods for step-size selection, line search and trust region, we focus on investigating the trust region methods. After presenting some detailed analysis, we develop novel and effective techniques to adjust the trust-region size.

To solve such learning problems, Stochastic Approximation offers an optimization approach to make complexity of each iteration independent of number of data points by taking only one data point or mini-batch of data points during each iteration and thereby helping to solve problems with large number of data points. Similarly, Coordinate Descent offers another optimization approach to make iteration complexity independent of the number of features/coordinates/variables by taking only one feature or block of features, instead of all, during an iteration and thereby helping to solve problems with large number of features. In this paper, an optimization framework, namely, Batch Block Optimization Framework has been developed to solve big data problems using the best of Stochastic Approximation as well as the best of Coordinate Descent approaches, independent of any solver. This framework is used to solve strongly convex and smooth empirical risk minimization problem with gradient descent (as a solver) and two novel Stochastic Average Adjusted Gradient methods have been proposed to reduce variance in mini-batch and block-coordinate setting of the developed framework.

In this paper, in order to reduce the modal extraction cost in serialized classification system, we propose a novel end-to-end serialized adaptive decision approach named Discriminative Modal Pursuit ({\sc Dmp}), which can automatically extract instance-specifically discriminative modal sequence for reducing the cost of feature extraction in the test phase. Rather than jointly optimize a highly non-convex empirical risk minimization problem, we are inspired by LSTM, and the proposed {\sc Dmp} can turn to learn the decision policies which predict the label information and decide the modalities to be extracted simultaneously within limited modal acquisition budget. Consequently, {\sc Dmp} approach can balance the classification performance and modal feature extraction cost by utilizing different modalities for different test instances. Empirical studies show that {\sc Dmp} is more efficient and effective than existing modal/feature extraction methods.},

Our DRO formulation allows us to interpret GSRL as a game, in which we learn a regression parameter while an adversary chooses a perturbation of the data. We wish to pick the parameter to minimize the expected loss under any plausible model chosen by the adversary - who, on the other hand, wishes to increase the expected loss. The regularization parameter turns out to be precisely determined by the amount of perturbation on the training data allowed by the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven (statistical) criterion for the optimal choice of regularization, which we evaluate asymptotically, in closed form, as the size of the training set increases. Our easy-to-evaluate regularization formula is compared against cross-validation, showing comparable performance.},

However, most existing multi-view graph based methods perform clustering on the fixed input graphs, and the results are dependent on the quality of input graphs. In this paper, instead of fixing the input graphs, we propose Multi-view clustering with Adaptively Learned Graph (MALG), learning a new common similarity matrix. In our model, we not only consider the importance of multiple graphs from view level, but also focus on the performance of similarities within a view from sample-pair level. Sample-pair-specific weights are introduced to exploit the connection across views in more depth. In addition, the obtained optimal graph can be partitioned into specific clusters directly, according to its connected components. Experimental results on toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

The key insight is to select a small part of the data graph that is sufficient to answer a given query in order to satisfy the specified constraints on time or accuracy.

First, we define a search space over candidate selection plans, and identify target selection plans corresponding to the training queries by performing an expensive search. Subsequently, we learn greedy search control knowledge to imitate the search behavior of the target selection plans. Our experiments on large-scale knowledge graphs including DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase show that using the learned selection plans, we can significantly improve the computational-efficiency of graph search to achieve high accuracy.},

The main idea is to represent the weight matrix of the locally connected layer as the product of the kernel and the smoother, where the kernel is shared over different local receptive fields, and the smoother is for determining the importance and relations of different local receptive fields. Specifically, a multi-variate Gaussian function is utilized to generate the smoother, for modeling the location relations among different local receptive fields. Furthermore, the content information can also be leveraged by setting the mean and precision of the Gaussian function according to the content. Experiments on some variant of MNIST clearly show our advantages over CNN and locally connected layer.},

In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap in these two research areas. We use a structure of block bandable covariance matrices to incorporate spatial dependence information, and study rate optimal estimation of this type of structured high dimensional covariance matrices.

Due to the strong characteristic of feature extraction in deep learning, many researchers have employed it with CF to extract effective representations and to enhance its performance in rating prediction. Based on this previous work, we propose a probabilistic model that combines a stacked denoising autoencoder and a convolutional neural network together with auxiliary side information (i.e, both from users and items) to extract users and items' latent factors, respectively.

This mechanism enhances the model capability by learning a variety of features in subnetworks. The proposed strategy explicitly shows that the features propagate through pathways in various routing patterns, which is referred to as pathway encoding of category information.

The performance of a BO method depends on its selection strategy through the acquisition function. Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition functions for BO that finds the expectation of the improvement function over the incumbent. The incumbent is usually selected as the best-observed value so far, termed as $y^{\max}$ (for the maximizing problem). Recent work has studied the convergence rate for EI under some mild assumptions or zero noise of observations. Especially, the work of Wang and de Freitas (2014) has derived the sublinear regret for EI under a stochastic noise. However, due to the difficulty in stochastic noise setting and to make the convergent proof feasible, they use an alternative choice for the incumbent as the maximum of the Gaussian process predictive mean, $\mu^{\max}$. This modification makes the algorithm computationally inefficient because it requires an additional global optimization step to estimate $\mu^{\max}$ that is costly and may be inaccurate. To address this issue, we derive a sublinear convergence rate for EI using the commonly used $y^{\max}$. Moreover, our analysis is the first to study a stopping criteria for EI to prevent unnecessary evaluations. Our analysis complements the results of Wang and de Freitas (2014) to theoretically cover two incumbent settings for EI. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that EI using $y^{\max}$ is both more computationally efficiency and more accurate than EI using $\mu^{\max}$.},

In addition we provide and compare with a beam search strategy for conditional probability maximisation.
Our algorithms are capable of convincingly re-harmonising famous musical works. To demonstrate this we provide visualisations, quantitative experiments, a human listening test and audio examples.

  abstract =     {\emph{Non-Gaussian component analysis} (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian ``signals'' from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as a generalization of \emph{projection pursuit} (PP) and \emph{independent component analysis} (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed, seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach called \emph{least-squares NGCA} (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution analytically through least-squares estimation of \emph{log-density gradients} and eigendecomposition. However, since \emph{pre-whitening} of data is involved in LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a \emph{whitening-free} variant of LSNGCA and experimentally demonstrate its superiority.},

Collecting training data for this problem is particularly challenging due to a high number of possible interfering devices, difficulty in obtaining precise timings, and the need to measure the devices in varying conditions. To overcome this challenge we focus on semi-supervised learning, aiming to minimize the need for reliable training samples while utilizing larger amounts of unsupervised labels to improve the accuracy. In particular, we propose a novel structured extension of the pseudo-label technique to take advantage of temporal continuity in the data and show that already a few seconds of training data for each device is sufficient for highly accurate recognition.},

In particular, we concentrate on the case where a set of candidate outputs has been given, and the associated pre-image problem calls for ranking the set of candidate outputs. Our method, called magnitude-preserving IOKR, both aims to produce a good approximation of the output feature vectors, and to preserve the magnitude differences of the output features in the candidate sets. For the case where the candidate set does not contain corresponding 'correct' inputs, we propose a method for approximating the inputs through application of IOKR in the reverse direction. We apply our method to two learning problems: cross-lingual document retrieval and metabolite identification. Experiments show that the proposed approach improves performance over IOKR, and in the latter application obtains the current state-of-the-art accuracy.},

In this paper, we propose a focused topic model where how a topic focuses on words is informed by word embeddings. Our models is able to discover more informed and focused topics with more representative words, leading to better modelling accuracy and topic quality. With the data argumentation technique, we can derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm that benefits from the fully local conjugacy of the model.

It does so by introducing a novel distributed optimizer which is able to efficiently optimize a centralized model under communication constraints. The optimizer achieves this by pushing a normalized sequence of first-order gradients to a parameter server. This implies that the magnitude of a worker delta is smaller compared to an accumulated gradient, and provides a better direction towards a minimum compared to first-order gradients, which in turn also forces possible implicit momentum fluctuations to be more aligned since we make the assumption that all workers contribute towards a single minima. As a result, our approach mitigates the parameter staleness problem more effectively since staleness in asynchrony induces (implicit) momentum, and achieves a better convergence rate compared to other optimizers such as asynchronous \textsc{easgd} and \textsc{dynsgd}, which we show empirically.},

  abstract =     {Deep learning methods have been actively researched for cross-modal retrieval, with the softmax cross-entropy loss commonly applied for supervised learning. However, the softmax cross-entropy loss is known to result in large intra-class variances, which is not not very suited for cross-modal matching. In this paper, a deep architecture called Deep Semantic Embedding (DSE) is proposed, which is trained in an end-to-end manner for image-text cross-modal retrieval. With images and texts mapped to a feature embedding space, class labels are used to guide the embedding learning, so that the embedding space has a semantic meaning common for both images and texts. This way, the difference between different modalities is eliminated. Under this framework, the center loss is introduced beyond the commonly used softmax cross-entropy loss to achieve both inter-class separation and intra-class compactness. Besides, a distance based softmax cross-entropy loss is proposed to jointly consider the softmax cross-entropy and center losses in fully gradient based learning. Experiments have been done on three popular image-text cross-modal retrieval databases, showing that the proposed algorithms have achieved the best overall performances.},

Based on deep convolutional neural networks, our approach first learns the discriminative semantic representation with the semantic-component-aware features for persons and then employs the Pyramid Matching Module to match the common semantic-components of persons, which is robust to the variation of spatial scales and misalignment of locations posed by viewpoint changes. The above two processes are jointly optimized via a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on the rank-1 recognition rate.},

We show that for a given computational budget the proposed algorithm almost always reaches a higher log-likelihood more rapidly, compared to the standard contrastive divergence algorithm. Further, we modify this algorithm to use the centered gradients and show that it is more efficient and effective compared to the standard centered gradient algorithm on benchmark datasets.},

We explore the space of search-based learning approaches to solve the problem of {\em multi-task structured prediction} (MTSP) in the context of entity analysis. In this paper, we study three different search architectures to solve MTSP problems that make different tradeoffs between speed and accuracy of training and inference. In all three architectures, we  learn one or more scoring functions that employ both intra-task and inter-task features. In the ``pipeline'' architecture, which is the fastest, we solve different tasks one after another in a pipelined fashion. In the ``joint'' architecture, which is the most expensive,  we formulate MTSP as a single-task structured prediction, and search the joint space of multi-task structured outputs. To improve the speed of joint architecture, we introduce two different pruning methods and associated learning techniques. In the intermediate ``cyclic'' architecture, we cycle through the tasks multiple times in sequence until there is no performance improvement.  Results on two benchmark domains show that the joint architecture improves over the pipeline approach as well as the previous state-of-the-art approach based on graphical models. The cyclic architecture is faster than the joint approach and achieves competitive performance.},

Specifically, instead of computing the value of the (outer) memory cell as $c^{outer}_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot g_t$, NLSTM memory cells use the concatenation $(f_t \odot c_{t-1}, i_t \odot g_t)$ as input to an inner LSTM (or NLSTM) memory cell, and set $c^{outer}_t$ = $h^{inner}_t$. Nested LSTMs outperform both stacked and single-layer LSTMs with similar numbers of parameters in our experiments on various character-level language modeling tasks, and the inner memories of an LSTM learn longer term dependencies compared with the higher-level units of a stacked LSTM.},

For simplicity, we assume that the optimal model parameters (also called ground-truth parameters) are known. We then assume that a network receives Gaussian input and is trained by minimizing the expected squared loss between the prediction function of the network and a target function. To conduct the analysis, we propose a normal equation for critical points, and study the invariances under three kinds of transformations, namely, scale transformation, rotation transformation and perturbation transformation. We prove that these transformations can keep the loss of a critical point invariant, thus can incur flat regions. Consequently, how to escape from flat regions is vital in training neural networks.},

  abstract =     {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are often significantly incomplete, necessitating a demand for KG completion. Path-based relation inference is one of the most important approaches to this task. Traditional methods treat each path between entity pairs as an atomic feature, thus inducing sparsity. Recently, neural network models solve this problem by decomposing a path as the sequence of relations in the path, before modelling path representations with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures. In cases there are multiple paths between an entity pair, state-of-the-art neural models either select only one path, or make usage of simple score pooling methods like Top-K, Average, LogSumExp. Unfortunately, none of these methods can model the scenario where relations can only be inferred by considering multiple informative paths collectively. In this paper, we propose a novel path-based relation inference model that learns entity pair representations with attentive path combination. Given an entity pair and a set of paths connecting the pair, our model allows for integrating information from each informative path, and form a dynamic entity pair representation for each query relation. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art path-based relation inference methods.},

  abstract =     {The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is an efficient derivative-free optimization algorithm. It optimizes a black-box objective function over a well defined parameter space. In some problems, such parameter spaces are defined using function approximation in which feature functions are manually defined. Therefore, the performance of those techniques strongly depends on the quality of chosen features. Hence, enabling CMA-ES to optimize on a more complex and general function class of the objective has long been desired. Specifically, we consider modeling the input space for black-box optimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). This modeling leads to a functional optimization problem whose domain is a function space that enables us to optimize in a very rich function class. In addition, we propose CMA-ES-RKHS, a generalized CMA-ES framework, that performs black-box functional optimization in RKHS. A search distribution, represented as a Gaussian process, is adapted by updating both its mean function and covariance operator. Adaptive representation of the mean function and the covariance operator is achieved by resorting to sparsification. CMA-ES-RKHS is evaluated on two simple functional optimization problems and two bench-mark reinforcement learning (RL) domains. For an application in RL, we model policies for MDPs in RKHS and transform a cumulative return objective as a functional of RKHS policies, which can be optimized via CMA-ES-RKHS. This formulation results in a black-box functional policy search framework.},

With the increased popularity of CNNs deployed on the wide-spectrum of platforms (from mobile devices to workstations), the answer to this question has drawn significant attention. From lengthening battery life of mobile devices to reducing the energy bill of a datacenter, it is important to understand the energy efficiency of CNNs during serving for making an inference, before actually training the model. In this work, we propose \NP: a layer-wise predictive framework based on sparse polynomial regression, for predicting the serving energy consumption of a CNN deployed on any GPU platform. Given the architecture of a CNN, \NP provides an accurate prediction and breakdown for power and runtime across all layers in the whole network, helping machine learners quickly identify the power, runtime, or energy bottlenecks. We also propose the \textit{``energy-precision ratio'' (EPR)} metric to guide machine learners in selecting an energy-efficient CNN architecture that better trades off the energy consumption and prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed \NP outperforms the best published model to date, yielding an improvement in accuracy of up to $68.5\%$. We also assess the accuracy of predictions at the network level, by predicting the runtime, power, and energy of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, achieving an average accuracy of $88.24\%$ in runtime, $88.34\%$ in power, and $97.21\%$ in energy. We comprehensively corroborate the effectiveness of \NP as a powerful framework for machine learners by testing it on different GPU platforms and Deep Learning software tools.},
