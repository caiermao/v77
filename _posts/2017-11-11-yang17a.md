title: 'Instance Specific Discriminative Modal Pursuit: A Serialized Approach'
abstract: With the fast development of data collection techniques, a huge amount of
  complex multi-modal data are generated, shared and stored on the Internet. The burden
  of extracting multi-modal features for test instances in data analysis becomes the
  main fact that hurts the efficiency of prediction.  In this paper, in order to reduce
  the modal extraction cost in serialized classification system, we propose a novel
  end-to-end serialized adaptive decision approach named Discriminative Modal Pursuit
  (\sc Dmp), which can automatically extract instance-specifically discriminative
  modal sequence for reducing the cost of feature extraction in the test phase. Rather
  than jointly optimize a highly non-convex empirical risk minimization problem, we
  are inspired by LSTM, and the proposed \sc Dmp can turn to learn the decision policies
  which predict the label information and decide the modalities to be extracted simultaneously
  within limited modal acquisition budget. Consequently, \sc Dmp approach can balance
  the classification performance and modal feature extraction cost by utilizing different
  modalities for different test instances. Empirical studies show that \sc Dmp is
  more efficient and effective than existing modal/feature extraction methods.
