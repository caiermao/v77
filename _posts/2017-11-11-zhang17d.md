title: Using Deep Neural Networks to Automate Large Scale Statistical Analysis for
  Big Data Applications
abstract: Statistical analysis (SA) is a complex process to deduce population properties
  from analysis of data. It usually takes a well-trained analyst to successfully perform
  SA, and it becomes extremely challenging to apply SA to big data applications. We
  propose to use deep neural networks  to automate the SA process. In particular,
  we propose to construct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform automatic
  model selection and parameter estimation, two most important SA tasks. We refer
  to the resulting CNNs as the neural model selector and the neural model estimator,
  respectively, which can be properly trained using labeled data systematically generated
  from candidate models. Simulation study shows that both the selector and estimator
  demonstrate excellent performances. The idea and proposed framework can be further
  extended to automate the entire SA process and have the potential to revolutionize
  how SA is performed in big data analytics.
