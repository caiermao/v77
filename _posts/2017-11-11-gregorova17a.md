title: Learning Predictive Leading Indicators for Forecasting Time Series Systems
  with Unknown Clusters of Forecast Tasks
abstract: We present a new method for forecasting systems of multiple interrelated
  time series. The method learns the forecast models together with discovering leading
  indicators from within the system that serve as good predictors improving the forecast
  accuracy and a cluster structure of the predictive tasks around these. The method
  is based on the classical linear vector autoregressive model (VAR) and links the
  discovery of the leading indicators to inferring sparse graphs of Granger causality.
  We formulate a new constrained optimisation problem to promote the desired sparse
  structures across the models and the sharing of information amongst the learning
  tasks in a multi-task manner. We propose an algorithm for solving the problem and
  document on a battery of synthetic and real-data experiments the advantages of our
  new method over baseline VAR models as well as the state-of-the-art sparse VAR learning
  methods.
