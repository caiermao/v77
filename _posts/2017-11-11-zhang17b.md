title: Adaptive Sampling Scheme for Learning in Severely Imbalanced Large Scale Data
abstract: Imbalanced data poses a serious challenge for many machine learning and
  data mining applications. It may significantly affect the performance of learning
  algorithms. In digital marketing applications, events of interest (positive instances
  for building predictive models) such as click and purchase are rare. A retail website
  can easily receive a million visits every day, yet only a small percentage of visits
  lead to purchase. The large amount of raw data and the small percentage of positive
  instances make it challenging to build decent predictive models in a timely fashion.
  In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy to deal with this problem.
  It efficiently returns high quality training data, ensures system responsiveness
  and improves predictive performances.
