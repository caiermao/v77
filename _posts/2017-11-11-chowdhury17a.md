title: 'Select-and-Evaluate: A Learning Framework for Large-Scale Knowledge Graph
  Search'
abstract: Querying graph structured data is a fundamental operation that enables important
  applications including knowledge graph search, social network analysis, and cyber-network
  security. However, the growing size of real-world data graphs poses severe challenges
  for graph search to meet the response-time requirements of the applications. To
  address these scalability challenges, we develop a learning framework for graph
  search called \bf Sele\bf ct-and-Ev\bf aluat\bf e (SCALE). The key insight is to
  select a small part of the data graph that is sufficient to answer a given query
  in order to satisfy the specified constraints on time or accuracy. We formulate
  the problem of generating the candidate subgraph as a computational search process
  and induce search control knowledge from training queries using imitation learning.
  First, we define a search space over candidate selection plans, and identify target
  selection plans corresponding to the training queries by performing an expensive
  search. Subsequently, we learn greedy search control knowledge to imitate the search
  behavior of the target selection plans. Our experiments on large-scale knowledge
  graphs including DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase show that using the learned selection
  plans, we can significantly improve the computational-efficiency of graph search
  to achieve high accuracy.
