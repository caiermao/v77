title: Semi-supervised Convolutional Neural Networks for Identifying Wi-Fi Interference
  Sources
abstract: We present a convolutional neural network for identifying radio frequency
  devices from signal data, in order to detect possible interference sources for wireless
  local area networks. Collecting training data for this problem is particularly challenging
  due to a high number of possible interfering devices, difficulty in obtaining precise
  timings, and the need to measure the devices in varying conditions. To overcome
  this challenge we focus on semi-supervised learning, aiming to minimize the need
  for reliable training samples while utilizing larger amounts of unsupervised labels
  to improve the accuracy. In particular, we propose a novel structured extension
  of the pseudo-label technique to take advantage of temporal continuity in the data
  and show that already a few seconds of training data for each device is sufficient
  for highly accurate recognition.
