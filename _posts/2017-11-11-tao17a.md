title: Multi-view Clustering with Adaptively Learned Graph
abstract: Multi-view clustering, which aims to improve the clustering performance
  by exploring the dataâ€™s multiple representations, has become an important research
  direction. Graph based methods have been widely studied and achieve promising performance
  for multi-view clustering. However, most existing multi-view graph based methods
  perform clustering on the fixed input graphs, and the results are dependent on the
  quality of input graphs. In this paper, instead of fixing the input graphs, we propose
  Multi-view clustering with Adaptively Learned Graph (MALG), learning a new common
  similarity matrix. In our model, we not only consider the importance of multiple
  graphs from view level, but also focus on the performance of similarities within
  a view from sample-pair level. Sample-pair-specific weights are introduced to exploit
  the connection across views in more depth. In addition, the obtained optimal graph
  can be partitioned into specific clusters directly, according to its connected components.
  Experimental results on toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of
  the proposed algorithm.
