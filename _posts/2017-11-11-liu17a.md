title: 'PHD: A Probabilistic Model of Hybrid Deep Collaborative Filtering for Recommender
  Systems'
abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF), a well-known approach in producing recommender
  systems, has achieved wide use and excellent performance not only in research but
  also in industry. However, problems related to cold start and data sparsity have
  caused CF to attract an increasing amount of attention in efforts to solve these
  problems. Traditional approaches adopt side information to extract effective latent
  factors but still have some room for growth. Due to the strong characteristic of
  feature extraction in deep learning, many researchers have employed it with CF to
  extract effective representations and to enhance its performance in rating prediction.
  Based on this previous work, we propose a probabilistic model that combines a stacked
  denoising autoencoder and a convolutional neural network together with auxiliary
  side information (i.e, both from users and items) to extract users and itemsâ€™ latent
  factors, respectively. Extensive experiments for four datasets demonstrate that
  our proposed model outperforms other traditional approaches and deep learning models
  making it state of the art.
