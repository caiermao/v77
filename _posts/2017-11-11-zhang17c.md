title: 'ST-GAN: Unsupervised Facial Image Semantic Transformation Using Generative
  Adversarial Networks'
abstract: Image semantic transformation aims to convert one image into another image
  with different semantic features (e.g., face pose, hairstyle). The previous methods,
  which learn the mapping function from one image domain to the other, require supervised
  information directly or indirectly. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised image
  semantic transformation method called semantic transformation generative adversarial
  networks (ST-GAN), and experimentally verify it on face dataset. We further improve
  ST-GAN with the Wasserstein distance to generate more realistic images and propose
  a method called local mutual information maximization to obtain a more explicit
  semantic transformation. ST-GAN has the ability to map the image semantic features
  into the latent vector and then perform transformation by controlling the latent
  vector.
