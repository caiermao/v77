title: Locally Smoothed Neural Networks
abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the locally connected layer are
  limited in capturing the importance and relations of different local receptive fields,
  which are often crucial for tasks such as face verification, visual question answering,
  and word sequence prediction. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel locally smoothed
  neural network (LSNN) in this paper. The main idea is to represent the weight matrix
  of the locally connected layer as the product of the kernel and the smoother, where
  the kernel is shared over different local receptive fields, and the smoother is
  for determining the importance and relations of different local receptive fields.
  Specifically, a multi-variate Gaussian function is utilized to generate the smoother,
  for modeling the location relations among different local receptive fields. Furthermore,
  the content information can also be leveraged by setting the mean and precision
  of the Gaussian function according to the content. Experiments on some variant of
  MNIST clearly show our advantages over CNN and locally connected layer.
