title: Pyramid Person Matching Network for Person Re-identification
abstract: In this work, we present a deep convolutional pyramid person matching network
  (PPMN) with specially designed Pyramid Matching Module to address the problem of
  person re-identification. The architecture takes a pair of RGB images as input,
  and outputs a similiarity value indicating whether the two input images represent
  the same person or not. Based on deep convolutional neural networks, our approach
  first learns the discriminative semantic representation with the semantic-component-aware
  features for persons and then employs the Pyramid Matching Module to match the common
  semantic-components of persons, which is robust to the variation of spatial scales
  and misalignment of locations posed by viewpoint changes. The above two processes
  are jointly optimized via a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments
  on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against
  the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on the rank-1 recognition rate.
