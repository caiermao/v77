title: Data sparse nonparametric regression with $ε$-insensitive losses
abstract: "Leveraging the celebrated\tsupport vector regression (SVR) method, we propose
  a unifying framework in order to deliver regression machines in reproducing kernel
  Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) with data sparsity. The central point is a new definition
  of $ε$-insensitivity, valid for many regression losses (including quantile and expectile
  regression) and their multivariate extensions.\tWe show that the dual optimization
  problem to empirical risk minimization with $ε$-insensitivity involves a data sparse
  regularization. We also provide an analysis of the excess of risk as well as a randomized
  coordinate descent algorithm for solving the dual.\tNumerical experiments validate
  our approach."
