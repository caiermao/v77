title: A Mutually-Dependent Hadamard Kernel for Modelling Latent Variable Couplings
abstract: We introduce a novel kernel that models input-dependent couplings across
  multiple latent processes. The pairwise joint kernel measures covariance along inputs
  and across different latent signals in a mutually-dependent fashion. A latent correlation
  Gaussian process (LCGP) model combines these non-stationary latent components into
  multiple outputs by an input-dependent mixing matrix. Probit classification and
  support for multiple observation sets are derived by Variational Bayesian inference.
  Results on several datasets indicate that the LCGP model can recover the correlations
  between latent signals while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance.
  We highlight the latent covariances with an EEG classification dataset where latent
  brain processes and their couplings simultaneously emerge from the model.
