title: A Quantum-Inspired Ensemble Method and Quantum-Inspired Forest Regressors
abstract: We propose a Quantum-Inspired Subspace(QIS) Ensemble Method for generating
  feature ensembles based on feature selections. We assign each principal component
  a Fraction Transition Probability as its probability weight based on Principal Component
  Analysis and quantum interpretations. In order to generate the feature subset for
  each base regressor, we select a feature subset from principal components based
  on Fraction Transition Probabilities. The idea originating from quantum mechanics
  can encourage ensemble diversity and the accuracy simultaneously. We incorporate
  Quantum-Inspired Subspace Method into Random Forest and propose Quantum-Inspired
  Forest. We theoretically prove that the quantum interpretation corresponds to the
  first order approximation of ensemble regression. We also evaluate the empirical
  performance of Quantum-Inspired Forest and Random Forest in multiple hyperparameter
  settings. Quantum-Inspired Forest proves the significant robustness of the default
  hyperparameters on most data sets. The contribution of this work is two-fold, a
  novel ensemble regression algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and the theoretical
  connection between quantum interpretations and machine learning algorithms.
