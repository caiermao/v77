title: Recognizing Art Style Automatically in Painting with Deep Learning
abstract: The artistic style (or artistic movement) of a painting is a rich descriptor
  that captures both visual and historical information about the painting. Correctly
  identifying the artistic style of a paintings is crucial for indexing large artistic
  databases. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep residual neural to solve
  the problem of detecting the artistic style of a painting and outperform existing
  approaches to reach an accuracy of $62%$ on the Wikipaintings dataset (for 25 different
  style). To achieve this result, the network is first pre-trained on ImageNet, and
  deeply retrained for artistic style. We empirically evaluate that to achieve the
  best performance, one need to retrain about 20 layers. This suggests that the two
  tasks are as similar as expected, and explain the previous success of hand crafted
  features. We also demonstrate that the style detected on the Wikipaintings dataset
  are consistent with styles detected on an independent dataset and describe a number
  of experiments we conducted to validate this approach both qualitatively and quantitatively.
