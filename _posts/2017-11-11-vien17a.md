title: A Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for Direct Policy Search
  in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is an efficient
  derivative-free optimization algorithm. It optimizes a black-box objective function
  over a well defined parameter space. In some problems, such parameter spaces are
  defined using function approximation in which feature functions are manually defined.
  Therefore, the performance of those techniques strongly depends on the quality of
  chosen features. Hence, enabling CMA-ES to optimize on a more complex and general
  function class of the objective has long been desired. Specifically, we consider
  modeling the input space for black-box optimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert
  spaces (RKHS). This modeling leads to a functional optimization problem whose domain
  is a function space that enables us to optimize in a very rich function class. In
  addition, we propose CMA-ES-RKHS, a generalized CMA-ES framework, that performs
  black-box functional optimization in RKHS. A search distribution, represented as
  a Gaussian process, is adapted by updating both its mean function and covariance
  operator. Adaptive representation of the mean function and the covariance operator
  is achieved by resorting to sparsification. CMA-ES-RKHS is evaluated on two simple
  functional optimization problems and two bench-mark reinforcement learning (RL)
  domains. For an application in RL, we model policies for MDPs in RKHS and transform
  a cumulative return objective as a functional of RKHS policies, which can be optimized
  via CMA-ES-RKHS. This formulation results in a black-box functional policy search
  framework.
