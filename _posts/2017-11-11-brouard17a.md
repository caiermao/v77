title: Magnitude-Preserving Ranking for Structured Outputs
abstract: 'In this paper, we present a novel method for solving structured prediction
  problems, based on combining Input Output Kernel Regression (IOKR) with an extension
  of magnitude-preserving ranking to structured output spaces. In particular, we concentrate
  on the case where a set of candidate outputs has been given, and the associated
  pre-image problem calls for ranking the set of candidate outputs. Our method, called
  magnitude-preserving IOKR, both aims to produce a good approximation of the output
  feature vectors, and to preserve the magnitude differences of the output features
  in the candidate sets. For the case where the candidate set does not contain corresponding
  ’correct’ inputs, we propose a method for approximating the inputs through application
  of IOKR in the reverse direction. We apply our method to two learning problems:
  cross-lingual document retrieval and metabolite identification. Experiments show
  that the proposed approach improves performance over IOKR, and in the latter application
  obtains the current state-of-the-art accuracy.'
