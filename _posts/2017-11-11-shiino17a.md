title: Whitening-Free Least-Squares Non-Gaussian Component Analysis
abstract: "\\emphNon-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear
  dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian “signals”
  from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded
  as a generalization of \\emphprojection pursuit (PP) and \\emphindependent component
  analysis (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed,
  seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach
  called \\emphleast-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution
  analytically through least-squares estimation of \\emphlog-density gradients and
  eigendecomposition. However, since \\emphpre-whitening of data is involved in LSNGCA,
  it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which
  is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a
  \\emphwhitening-free variant of LSNGCA and experimentally demonstrate its superiority."
