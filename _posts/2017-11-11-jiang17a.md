title: Attentive Path Combination for Knowledge Graph Completion
abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are often significantly incomplete, necessitating
  a demand for KG completion. Path-based relation inference is one of the most important
  approaches to this task. Traditional methods treat each path between entity pairs
  as an atomic feature, thus inducing sparsity. Recently, neural network models solve
  this problem by decomposing a path as the sequence of relations in the path, before
  modelling path representations with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures.
  In cases there are multiple paths between an entity pair, state-of-the-art neural
  models either select only one path, or make usage of simple score pooling methods
  like Top-K, Average, LogSumExp. Unfortunately, none of these methods can model the
  scenario where relations can only be inferred by considering multiple informative
  paths collectively. In this paper, we propose a novel path-based relation inference
  model that learns entity pair representations with attentive path combination. Given
  an entity pair and a set of paths connecting the pair, our model allows for integrating
  information from each informative path, and form a dynamic entity pair representation
  for each query relation. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world
  dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves better performance
  than state-of-the-art path-based relation inference methods.
