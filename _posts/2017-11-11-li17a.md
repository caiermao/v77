title: Rate Optimal Estimation for High Dimensional Spatial Covariance Matrices
abstract: Spatial covariance matrix estimation is of great significance in many applications
  in climatology, econometrics and many other fields with complex data structures
  involving spatial dependencies. High dimensionality brings new challenges to this
  problem, and no theoretical optimal estimator has been proved for the spatial high-dimensional
  covariance matrix. Over the past decade, the method of regularization has been introduced
  to high-dimensional covariance estimation for various structured matrices, to achieve
  rate optimal estimators. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap in these two research
  areas. We use a structure of block bandable covariance matrices to incorporate spatial
  dependence information, and study rate optimal estimation of this type of structured
  high dimensional covariance matrices. A double tapering estimator is proposed, and
  is shown to achieve the asymptotic minimax error bound. Numerical studies on both
  synthetic and real data are conducted showing the improvement of the double tapering
  estimator over the sample covariance matrix estimator.
