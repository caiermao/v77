title: Learning Convolutional Neural Networks using Hybrid Orthogonal Projection and
  Estimation
abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded the excellent performance
  in a variety of computer vision tasks, where CNNs typically adopt a similar structure
  consisting of convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers. In
  this paper, we propose to apply a novel method, namely Hybrid Orthogonal Projection
  and Estimation (HOPE), to CNNs in order to introduce orthogonality into the CNN
  structure. The HOPE model can be viewed as a hybrid model to combine feature extraction
  using orthogonal linear projection with mixture models. It is an effective model
  to extract useful information from the original high-dimension feature vectors and
  meanwhile filter out irrelevant noises. In this work, we present three different
  ways to apply the HOPE models to CNNs, i.e., \em HOPE-Input, \em single-HOPE-Block
  and \em multi-HOPE-Blocks. For \em HOPE-Input CNNs, a HOPE layer is directly used
  right after the input to de-correlate high-dimension input feature vectors. Alternatively,
  in \em single-HOPE-Block and \em multi-HOPE-Blocks CNNs, we consider to use HOPE
  layers to replace one or more blocks in the CNNs, where one block may include several
  convolutional layers and one pooling layer. The experimental results on CIFAR-10,
  CIFAR-100 and ImageNet databases have shown that the orthogonal constraints imposed
  by the HOPE layers can significantly improve the performance of CNNs in these image
  classification tasks (we have achieved one of the best performance when image augmentation
  has not been applied, and top 5 performance with image augmentation).
