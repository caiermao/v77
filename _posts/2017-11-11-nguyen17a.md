title: Regret for Expected Improvement over the Best-Observed Value and Stopping Condition
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient method for global optimization
  of expensive, noisy, black-box functions using probabilistic methods. The performance
  of a BO method depends on its selection strategy through the acquisition function.
  Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition functions for
  BO that finds the expectation of the improvement function over the incumbent. The
  incumbent is usually selected as the best-observed value so far, termed as $y^\max$
  (for the maximizing problem). Recent work has studied the convergence rate for EI
  under some mild assumptions or zero noise of observations. Especially, the work
  of Wang and de Freitas (2014) has derived the sublinear regret for EI under a stochastic
  noise. However, due to the difficulty in stochastic noise setting and to make the
  convergent proof feasible, they use an alternative choice for the incumbent as the
  maximum of the Gaussian process predictive mean, $μ^\max$. This modification makes
  the algorithm computationally inefficient because it requires an additional global
  optimization step to estimate $μ^\max$ that is costly and may be inaccurate. To
  address this issue, we derive a sublinear convergence rate for EI using the commonly
  used $y^\max$. Moreover, our analysis is the first to study a stopping criteria
  for EI to prevent unnecessary evaluations. Our analysis complements the results
  of Wang and de Freitas (2014) to theoretically cover two incumbent settings for
  EI. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that EI using $y^\max$ is both more computationally
  efficiency and more accurate than EI using $μ^\max$.
