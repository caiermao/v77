title: Mini-batch Block-coordinate based Stochastic Average Adjusted Gradient Methods
  to Solve Big Data Problems
abstract: Big Data problems in Machine Learning have large number of data points or
  large number of features, or both, which make training of models difficult because
  of high computational complexities of single iteration of learning algorithms. To
  solve such learning problems, Stochastic Approximation offers an optimization approach
  to make complexity of each iteration independent of number of data points by taking
  only one data point or mini-batch of data points during each iteration and thereby
  helping to solve problems with large number of data points. Similarly, Coordinate
  Descent offers another optimization approach to make iteration complexity independent
  of the number of features/coordinates/variables by taking only one feature or block
  of features, instead of all, during an iteration and thereby helping to solve problems
  with large number of features. In this paper, an optimization framework, namely,
  Batch Block Optimization Framework has been developed to solve big data problems
  using the best of Stochastic Approximation as well as the best of Coordinate Descent
  approaches, independent of any solver. This framework is used to solve strongly
  convex and smooth empirical risk minimization problem with gradient descent (as
  a solver) and two novel Stochastic Average Adjusted Gradient methods have been proposed
  to reduce variance in mini-batch and block-coordinate setting of the developed framework.
  Theoretical analysis prove linear convergence of the proposed methods and empirical
  results with bench marked datasets prove the superiority of proposed methods against
  existing methods.
