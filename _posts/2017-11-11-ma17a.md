title: 'Multi-Task Structured Prediction for Entity Analysis: Search-Based Learning
  Algorithms'
abstract: Entity analysis in natural language processing involves solving multiple
  structured prediction problems such as mention detection, coreference resolution,
  and entity linking. We explore the space of search-based learning approaches to
  solve the problem of \em multi-task structured prediction (MTSP) in the context
  of entity analysis. In this paper, we study three different search architectures
  to solve MTSP problems that make different tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
  of training and inference. In all three architectures, we  learn one or more scoring
  functions that employ both intra-task and inter-task features. In the “pipeline”
  architecture, which is the fastest, we solve different tasks one after another in
  a pipelined fashion. In the “joint” architecture, which is the most expensive,  we
  formulate MTSP as a single-task structured prediction, and search the joint space
  of multi-task structured outputs. To improve the speed of joint architecture, we
  introduce two different pruning methods and associated learning techniques. In the
  intermediate “cyclic” architecture, we cycle through the tasks multiple times in
  sequence until there is no performance improvement.  Results on two benchmark domains
  show that the joint architecture improves over the pipeline approach as well as
  the previous state-of-the-art approach based on graphical models. The cyclic architecture
  is faster than the joint approach and achieves competitive performance.
