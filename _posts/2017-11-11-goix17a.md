title: One Class Splitting Criteria for Random Forests
abstract: Random Forests (RFs) are strong machine learning tools for classification
  and regression. However, they remain supervised algorithms, and no extension of
  RFs to the one-class setting has been proposed, except for techniques based on second-class
  sampling. This work fills this gap by proposing a natural methodology to extend
  standard splitting criteria to the one-class setting, structurally generalizing
  RFs to one-class classification. An extensive benchmark of seven state-of-the-art
  anomaly detection algorithms is also presented. This empirically demonstrates the
  relevance of our approach.
