title: Computer Assisted Composition with Recurrent Neural Networks
abstract: "Sequence modeling with neural networks has lead to powerful models of symbolic
  music data. We address the problem of exploiting these models to reach creative
  musical goals, by combining with human input. To this end we generalise previous
  work, which sampled Markovian sequence models under the constraint that the sequence
  belong to the language of a given finite state machine provided by the human. We
  consider more expressive non-Markov models, thereby requiring approximate sampling
  which we provide in the form of an efficient sequential Monte Carlo method. In addition
  we provide and compare with a beam search strategy for conditional probability maximisation.\r
  Our algorithms are capable of convincingly re-harmonising famous musical works.
  To demonstrate this we provide visualisations, quantitative experiments, a human
  listening test and audio examples. We find both the sampling and optimisation procedures
  to be effective, yet complementary in character. For the case of highly permissive
  constraint sets, we find that sampling is to be preferred due to the overly regular
  nature of the optimisation based results. The generality of our algorithms permits
  countless other creative applications."
