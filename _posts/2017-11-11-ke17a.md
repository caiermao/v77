title: Radical-level Ideograph Encoder for RNN-based Sentiment Analysis of Chinese
  and Japanese
abstract: The character vocabulary can be very large in non-alphabetic languages such
  as Chinese and Japanese, which makes neural network models huge to process such
  languages. We explored a model for sentiment classification that takes the embeddings
  of the radicals of the Chinese characters, i.e, hanzi of Chinese and kanji of Japanese.
  Our model is composed of a CNN word feature encoder and a bi-directional RNN document
  feature encoder. The results achieved are on par with the character embedding-based
  models, and close to the state-of-the-art word embedding-based models, with 90%
  smaller vocabulary, and at least 13% and 80% fewer parameters than the character
  embedding-based models and word embedding-based models respectively. The results
  suggest that the radical embeddingbased approach is cost-effective for machine learning
  on Chinese and Japanese.
