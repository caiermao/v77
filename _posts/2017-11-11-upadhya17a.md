title: Learning RBM with a DC programming Approach
abstract: By exploiting the property that the RBM log-likelihood function is the difference
  of convex functions, we formulate a stochastic variant of the difference of convex
  functions (DC) programming to minimize the negative log-likelihood. Interestingly,
  the traditional contrastive divergence algorithm is a special case of the above
  formulation and the hyperparameters of the two algorithms can be chosen such that
  the amount of computation per mini-batch is identical. We show that for a given
  computational budget the proposed algorithm almost always reaches a higher log-likelihood
  more rapidly, compared to the standard contrastive divergence algorithm. Further,
  we modify this algorithm to use the centered gradients and show that it is more
  efficient and effective compared to the standard centered gradient algorithm on
  benchmark datasets.
