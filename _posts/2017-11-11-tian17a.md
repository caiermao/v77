title: Recovering Probability Distributions from Missing Data
abstract: A probabilistic query may not be estimable from observed data corrupted
  by missing values if the data are not missing at random (MAR). It is therefore of
  theoretical interest and practical importance to determine in principle whether
  a probabilistic query is estimable from missing data or not when the data are not
  MAR. We present algorithms that systematically determine whether the joint probability
  distribution or a target marginal distribution is estimable from observed data with
  missing values,  assuming that the data-generation model is represented as a Bayesian
  network, known as m-graphs, that not only encodes the dependencies among the variables
  but also explicitly portrays the mechanisms responsible for the missingness process.
  The results significantly advance the existing work.
